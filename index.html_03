									<span class="date">What is Falconry ?</span>
									<h2><a href="#">Falconry is a hunting sport<br />using a trained bird of prey to hunt wild quarry in it's natural habitat</a></h2>
									<p>The Art of Falconry dates back over 4000 years and is recognized today by UNESCO as being of significant human cultural heritage. Falconry has long been recognized as high input, low impact recreational-use of wildlife and the training of and hunting with birds of prey has been practiced since 2000 BC and was originally used as a means of catching food for the table before the advent of gunpowder. It has been officially provided for in Alberta under the Wildlife Act since 1981.
									</p>
								</header>The Alberta Game-Hawking Club is a private organization whose members are dedicated to the conservation of raptors and their prey and to falconry as a source of recreational enjoyment. Not all members actively fly birds, but many have extensive experience handling and training falconry birds. Some may be actively involved in domestic breeding programs, some in field research and others in rehabilitation projects for injured wild raptors. The association maintains a strict code of ethics. Each member is ranked and regulated according to his or her falconry knowledge and expertise.
								<a href="#" class="image main"><p>Why is falconry considered a valid recreational activity?
								The challenge and skill associated with the training of and hunting with falconry birds provide satisfaction, enjoyment and outdoor recreation to falconers with no negative impact on the populations of wild raptors or their prey. Additional benefits are gained from developing domestic breeding techniques and increased public awareness of wildlife.
								Trained raptors have higher survival rates than wild birds and are maintained in peak physical condition. They are assured of food and generally protected from disease and predators. Some falconry birds are accidentally lost while flying and some are intentionally released back into the wild, where they add to the free ranging populations.

										<h2><a href="#">The Apprenticeship Program<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/0081.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The Alberta Gamehawking Club is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting and protecting the art and practice of falconry, and the raptors it employs. The requirement for novice falconers to successfully complete an apprenticeship period is a requirement of almost all regulatory juresdictions in North America. We support this requirement and believe that an effective apprenticeship program is essential to the long-term welfare of falconry.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>What are the legal requirements?
										Falconry is highly regulated. As falconers we have a tremendous responsibility to the birds we possess. All raptors are protected by federal laws. These subjects and more are part of an apprentices "need to know" learning period and is part of the role of their supervisor.
